    "The task of language detection comes into use when you are working on a very large dataset that contains data in different languages. Suppose you want to create an even driven program where the final output depends on the language which the user provides as an input. So it is important to first detect the language of the text provided by the user before taking any action. So, in this article, I will take you through the task of language detection with Python."

You can build your machine learning model for the language detection task, but for this article, I will be using the langdetect package in Python which can detect over 55 different languages within a few lines of code."

So the user can enter text in whatever language the user likes, your program will detect that language but it will give the short form of that language as output.
